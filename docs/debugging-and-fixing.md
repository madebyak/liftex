Here's a list of stuff that we need to debug and fix / improve
make sure you double check with our codes and everything to ensure bugs-free implementation and no conflicts


1. the transition of the hero slider in the homepage is not nice 
we need to replace it completly with this effect inside this folder 
inspiration/slider-inspo/SlideshowAnimations-main
the effect we will use is this one inspiration/slider-inspo/SlideshowAnimations-main/index6.html

please make sure you do it properly 
then the headline of the hero slider we have is not properly aligned to center of the continaer, or maybe even the container is not properly aligned as well to cneter 
ensure the headline and subheading center aligned and centered paragraph
also ensure there are breakpoints for screens 

2. add slide arrows and mobile slide support for homepage > hero slider

3. the whole website has horizantal ability to scroll or move the screen if you understand what i mean, this is not logical fix this 

4. any word in ar or en saying micro lift subheading < 900 mm wide , change it to bigger than 1100mm 

5. the about us page > hero headline , change the arabic phrasing to something better and makes more sense in arabic even if you needed to change the meanign 

6. there's a problem specificaly with services page, on Edge browser (browser by microsoft) the services are not showing neither the section BG black neither the texts which is very weird, can you investiaget 

7. the complete responsive mobile friendly version for the whole website needs to be checked professionally and best practise approach 

8. Can we make the navbar in the beggning when you open the page is transperent bg, but the moment you start scrolling the white bg we have right now start fading in?
