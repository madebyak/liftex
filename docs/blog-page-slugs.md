Modernising Old Elevators: How to Upgrade Without Starting Over
Elevators are one of the most important yet overlooked systems in a building. While they may continue to run for decades, many older systems lack the safety features, energy efficiency, and user experience that modern buildings—and modern users—expect. But replacing an entire lift system from scratch can be costly and disruptive. The good news? You don’t have to start over. Elevator modernisation is a smart, effective way to breathe new life into your existing system.

Why Modernise an Old Lift?
There are three main reasons to consider modernization: safety, efficiency, and performance. Many older elevators still use relay-based controllers, outdated motors, and mechanical door systems—all of which can contribute to breakdowns, safety risks, and higher operating costs. By upgrading specific components, such as the control panel, drive system, or doors, you can significantly improve reliability and energy consumption without replacing the entire structure.
Modernisation also helps buildings comply with updated safety codes and standards. Features like door sensors, energy-efficient lighting, automatic rescue devices, and modern braking systems are now considered essential for public and private facilities alike. This is especially important in fast-growing markets like Iraq, where many older buildings were fitted with lifts that now fall short of today’s safety expectations.

The Modernisation Process
The process typically begins with a full on-site assessment. Engineers inspect the condition of each component—from the machine room and hoist mechanisms to the control system and cab interior. Based on this, they develop a phased upgrade plan that prioritises the most critical systems first.
In many cases, the modernisation process is designed to avoid service disruption. For example, replacing outdated motors and control systems can often be done with minimal downtime while the building remains operational. Upgrading the cabin aesthetics—like lighting, buttons, and interior finishes—can usually be done in just a few days.

Balancing Cost and Value
For many property owners and facility managers in Iraq, the cost of full elevator replacement simply isn’t feasible. That’s where modernization makes sense. Depending on the scale of upgrades, you can extend the useful life of a lift by 15 to 20 years—often at a fraction of the cost of total replacement.
In addition to performance and safety improvements, modern lifts are also more energy-efficient. This is particularly valuable in regions where power fluctuations and energy conservation are key concerns, as in many parts of Iraq.

Elevator Solutions in Iraq: Challenges and Opportunities
As Iraq enters a new era of rebuilding and expansion, vertical mobility is becoming more essential than ever. Across cities like Baghdad, Erbil, Basra, and beyond, we’re seeing the rise of multi-storey apartment blocks, commercial hubs, healthcare complexes, and government buildings—all of which rely on elevator systems to function smoothly. But while the demand for lifts and escalators is steadily rising, the road ahead is not without its obstacles.
In this evolving environment, the elevator industry in Iraq is navigating a complex mix of challenges and opportunities—each shaping the future of how people move within the country’s growing urban spaces.

The Landscape: A Market in Transition
Over the past few years, Iraq has witnessed a growing demand for modern infrastructure, driven by both public investment and private sector development. Large-scale projects in residential housing, hospitality, and retail are expanding across major cities, pushing the need for high-quality vertical transportation solutions.
According to market forecasts, Iraq’s elevator and escalator sector is set to experience substantial growth between 2020 and 2026, as the government promotes urban regeneration and the construction sector picks up momentum. New real estate developments are no longer simply looking for functionality—they demand smart, sustainable, and aesthetically integrated elevator systems that can complement the architecture while meeting international standards.

The Barriers: Power, Policy, and Practicality
Despite this positive outlook, the reality on the ground remains complex. One of the most pressing issues is Iraq’s unstable electrical grid. In many areas, sudden outages and voltage drops are frequent, putting elevator systems at risk of malfunction. This makes emergency features like UPS systems or generator integration essential—not just optional.
Another key challenge lies in regulation. While Iraq is progressing, it currently lacks comprehensive, uniformly enforced elevator safety codes. Unlike countries in the Gulf or Europe, where strict inspection frameworks exist, Iraq’s oversight mechanisms are still evolving. This has led to inconsistent installation quality and maintenance practices across different regions, especially in privately managed buildings.
Additionally, import dependency poses a hurdle. Many elevator parts, particularly advanced control systems or specialised components, need to be sourced from abroad. Delays in customs, fluctuating foreign exchange rates, and lack of local availability can cause setbacks in project timelines or force compromises in system quality.
Maintenance is another often-overlooked area. Many building owners in Iraq still treat elevator servicing as reactive rather than preventive. It’s not uncommon for maintenance to be delayed until a failure occurs, increasing safety risks and long-term repair costs.

The Opportunities: Innovation, Design, and Local Expertise
Yet, it is within these challenges that some of the most exciting opportunities lie. Iraq’s dynamic construction sector offers fertile ground for innovative elevator designs—solutions that are not only mechanically robust but also flexible, stylish, and adapted to a variety of building types.
With Iraq’s buildings ranging from traditional low-rise residential blocks to high-tech commercial towers, there is a growing appetite for:
•	Energy-efficient elevators that reduce operational costs.
•	Custom-sized lifts to suit tight spaces or unconventional layouts.
•	Modernised aesthetics that match premium interiors.
•	Smart elevator systems capable of predictive maintenance and user optimisation.
This is where local knowledge becomes critical. Developers and project managers are increasingly seeking out companies that understand not just the technology—but the local environment, logistics, and construction norms. That's where Liftex steps in.

Top 5 Signs Your Building Needs a Lift Maintenance Check
Elevators are designed to last for decades, but longevity doesn’t happen by chance. Like any other piece of machinery, a lift system depends on consistent upkeep to remain safe, smooth, and reliable. Unfortunately, many property owners or managers delay maintenance until something goes wrong — and by then, it’s often far more expensive to fix.
The best way to protect your building, tenants, and bottom line is to stay ahead of potential issues. By knowing what signs to look for, you can catch problems early and take action before they lead to serious safety hazards or expensive repairs.
Here are the top five warning signs that your building's elevator may be overdue for a professional maintenance check.

1. Frequent Small Breakdowns
It might start with something seemingly minor: the doors hesitate before closing, the elevator gets stuck for a few seconds, or you receive a complaint about an unexpected jolt during operation. These little issues are more than just inconveniences — they’re often symptoms of larger problems.
Frequent malfunctions, even if they seem isolated, can point to aging components like relays, switches, or outdated controllers that are on the verge of failure. These signs should never be ignored. A technician's inspection at this stage could prevent a major shutdown in the near future.

2. Unusual Noises or Vibrations
An elevator should operate smoothly and quietly. If you start hearing grinding, squeaking, buzzing, or knocking sounds — or if you notice the cab shudders slightly during movement — that’s a red flag.
These sounds often indicate wear and tear in critical parts such as the guide rails, traction system, or motor. Left unattended, such issues can worsen rapidly, creating safety risks and potentially putting your lift out of service. A professional can identify and replace the worn parts before they fail completely.

3. Slower Ride or Delayed Door Response
Elevators that feel sluggish or have slow-responding doors aren’t just annoying — they signal that the system is struggling to perform. Riders may notice that the elevator takes longer to reach a floor, or that doors hesitate before opening or closing fully.
This kind of delay may stem from an underperforming motor, software lag, dirty tracks, or outdated sensors. Not only does this affect the overall user experience, but it also increases the risk of door entrapment or ride interruptions — especially during peak hours.

4. Uneven Floor Leveling
When an elevator stops slightly above or below floor level, even by a few centimetres, it becomes a hazard. Passengers may trip when exiting the cab, which poses a significant liability risk for property managers — particularly in buildings accessed by the elderly, children, or people with disabilities.
This condition, called “misleveling,” is commonly caused by worn-out brakes, miscalibrated sensors, or issues with the motor's stopping precision. It should be addressed immediately to maintain both safety and compliance.

5. Outdated Appearance or Technology
While appearance may not seem like a functional concern, it speaks volumes about the overall state of your elevator. If the interior looks worn, buttons are loose, or the control panel feels outdated, chances are the internal systems are aging too.
Modern elevator systems often include features like touchless buttons, digital floor indicators, energy-saving lighting, and voice prompts — not just for style, but for safety and accessibility. An outdated look could be a sign that it's time to not only refresh the design but also check the technology running behind it.

Putting Safety First:

Routine elevator maintenance isn’t just about avoiding breakdowns — it’s about protecting people, preserving property value, and preventing high repair costs. A well-maintained lift ensures smooth operation, satisfies users, and meets safety regulations.
